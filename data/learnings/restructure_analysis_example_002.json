    "Select segments that start mid-crisis with a vivid, concrete image (e.g., body degradation + improvised fix: 'Flossen vergammelt' + 'Kindersocken' + 'Kabelbinder') rather than setup/introduction.",
    "Prioritize first-person culpability + moral reversal language (e.g., 'was haben wir denn da eigentlich gemacht? Seid ihr irre?') because it creates conflict and self-judgment without needing context.",
    "Keep segments containing hard contrast metrics (natural lifespan vs captive lifespan; daily visitors) to compress explanation into numbers: '100 Jahre' vs '6 Monate', '10\u201312 Leute t\u00e4glich'.",
    "Choose segments where the audience\u2019s expected 'education/awareness' outcome is explicitly disproven (people watch \u2192 no behavior change). This creates a contrarian takeaway and a clear thesis in <40s.",
    "End on an irreversible outcome stated plainly ('war er tot') to provide a definitive payoff and prevent the clip from feeling like a teaser.",
    "Remove host framing, biography, and credential-building (e.g., childhood fish hobby, job titles, 'herzlich willkommen') unless it directly increases stakes within the first 2\u20133 seconds.",
    "Remove abstract ethical generalizations (e.g., 'Tiere einsperren ist nicht zeitgem\u00e4\u00df') when a visceral anecdote can embody the same point faster.",
    "Avoid segments requiring external visuals or long context (e.g., whale shark description, pricing, global aquarium counts) unless they are essential to the punchline; prefer self-contained micro-story beats."
