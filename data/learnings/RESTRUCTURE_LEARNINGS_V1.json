  "segment_selection": {
    "rules": [
      "Remove medical/relationship backstory detail (injury, depression, breakup, clinics) when the viral clip goal is a broad, non-niche life lesson rather than empathy narrative.",
      "Remove host framing, biography, and credential-building (e.g., childhood fish hobby, job titles, 'herzlich willkommen') unless it directly increases stakes within the first 2\u20133 seconds.",
      "Remove segments that are host intros, credentials, or mission statements (speaker bio, applause, 'in den n\u00e4chsten 18 Minuten', brand positioning) because they delay value delivery.",
      "Select segments that contain implicit consumer relevance ('in the supermarket', '19 or 29 cents') to anchor the claim in the viewer\u2019s daily life.",
      "Remove segments that require prior narrative context (e.g., earlier life-meaning framing, seminar setup, audience exercises) to understand why it matters.",
      "Select a self-contained moral claim that is understandable without prior context (e.g., 'Menschenaffen sch\u00e4men sich' + explanation).",
      "Select contiguous segments that already form a mini-arc (model \u2192 problem \u2192 consequence \u2192 advice) to minimize the need for editorial bridging.",
      "Start on an imperative contrarian command that challenges a common habit (e.g., 'H\u00f6rt bitte auf \u2026'). Prioritize segments where the first sentence is actionable and slightly provocative.",
      "Remove segments that require domain backstory (fish supply chain, whale shark pricing) unless the clip\u2019s core claim depends on it.",
      "Keep segments that open with an immediately relatable conflict framed as a funny/true observation (e.g., 'Wir sprechen verschiedene Sprachen') rather than a philosophical setup.",
      "Remove segments that require biographical setup (e.g., personal history, origin story, childhood, 'how it started') unless they directly support the framework in <10 seconds.",
      "End on a strong evaluative button line ('Das ist brutal.') or equivalent moral verdict; if none exists, select the nearest high-emotion judgment sentence as the final segment.",
      "Select segments that create an 'enemy/target + contrast' structure within 1 sentence (e.g., 'supplement industry vs tobacco/alcohol/pharma').",
      "Prefer segments that introduce concrete characters + setting in the first 3\u20135s (e.g., 'Kinder\u2026 alter Mann\u2026 Stra\u00dfe') to reduce context load and increase comprehension without prior longform context.",
      "Remove intro/credential/build-up segments (host introduction, speaker bio, mission statements, event context). If a segment contains names, accolades, or stage logistics, exclude it.",
      "Select segments that contain an explicit implication cue ('mal dr\u00fcber nachdenken', 'aber...') that invites the viewer to form a conclusion (curiosity + controversy).",
      "Prefer segments with direct speech/quoted dialogue (Q/A lines) because they create instant scene + characters without context.",
      "Remove atmospheric B-roll / scene-setting (river, paddling, 'watch the atmosphere') because it slows pacing and reduces idea-per-second in short-form.",
      "Remove segments that rely on long philosophical framing, citations (e.g., Goethe), or multi-step conceptual buildup that requires >10s before the viewer understands the point.",
      "Select segments that start mid-crisis with a vivid, concrete image (e.g., body degradation + improvised fix: 'Flossen vergammelt' + 'Kindersocken' + 'Kabelbinder') rather than setup/introduction.",
      "Select segments that explain a single causal mechanism in one chain: action \u2192 trigger \u2192 consequence (e.g., 'Wecker rei\u00dft\u2026 mitten im Zyklus' \u2192 'Schlaftrunkenheit').",
      "End on a strong normative verdict ('v\u00f6llig absurd', 'nicht mehr zeitgem\u00e4\u00df') to provide closure and shareability.",
      "Keep segments that contain direct speech/quoted dialogue; dialogue provides natural cut points and increases perceived immediacy.",
      "Keep segments with an explicit, contrarian or prescriptive opener (imperative/negation), e.g., 'Arbeite niemals\u2026' to function as an immediate thesis.",
      "Keep the first segment that contains a contrarian or alarming reframe (e.g., 'bei vielen Menschen f\u00e4ngt direkt danach der Anfang vom Ende an') because it converts recognition into tension.",
      "Select segments that start with a universal model/framework (e.g., 'Lebenslinie' timeline) that can be understood with zero context from the longform.",
      "Remove segments that set up broad context (societal problem framing, 'Massenph\u00e4nomen') unless they contain a surprising statistic or direct rule.",
      "Avoid segments with long emotional buildup before the first clear point; short-form selection favors immediate thesis over gradual reveal.",
      "Keep segments that can be understood with zero prior context (no references to earlier definitions like TH-cells, gut surface area, etc.).",
      "Choose segments with a clear escalating beat: question \u2192 wrong literal answer \u2192 time passes \u2192 internal frustration \u2192 explicit 'translation' reveal.",
      "Select segments that end with an immediate, easy-to-execute solution statement (e.g., 'Wir k\u00f6nnen es vermeiden\u2026 wenn\u2026') to deliver payoff before drop-off.",
      "Select segments that contain sensory/visualizable nouns and locations (Holland/Spain, Supermarkt, Boden/Erdreich, Wattebausch, Zuckerbad, Gew\u00e4chshaus, Etagen) because they generate imagery without needing visuals.",
      "Prefer segments that contain a 'soft hedge' ('Vermutung') which reduces perceived risk while still delivering a provocative claim.",
      "Select segments that immediately answer 'why/ how' with a vivid mechanism explanation (e.g., 'never saw soil' \u2192 'grown on cotton in sugar bath' \u2192 'stacked greenhouses'). Keep the causal chain intact.",
      "Avoid segments where the 'why it matters' is delayed beyond ~45s; if the explanation cannot land by the final 5\u20138s, do not select.",
      "Select segments that include a clear 'don\u2019t do X' contrast immediately after the rule (e.g., 'nicht 7,0 oder 8,0'), creating a binary decision for the viewer.",
      "Remove interviewer questions, topic pivots, and hedging phrases; keep uninterrupted monologue blocks for retention.",
      "Keep segments containing hard contrast metrics (natural lifespan vs captive lifespan; daily visitors) to compress explanation into numbers: '100 Jahre' vs '6 Monate', '10\u201312 Leute t\u00e4glich'.",
      "Keep segments that introduce a concrete, relatable 'stuckness' metaphor anchored in everyday routine (job route, projects, same pizzeria order) to make the abstract thesis visceral.",
      "Select segments that immediately justify the command with a concrete analogy/metaphor that compresses complexity into a vivid image (e.g., 'Transatlantikflug Richtung New York' to explain circadian shift).",
      "Choose segments where the audience\u2019s expected 'education/awareness' outcome is explicitly disproven (people watch \u2192 no behavior change). This creates a contrarian takeaway and a clear thesis in <40s.",
      "Prefer segments that stack multiple data points in rapid succession (list escalation) to create momentum and perceived evidence density.",
      "Include segments where numbers/amounts/countdowns change; numeric steps act as natural 'beat markers' and make the progression easy to follow.",
      "Keep segments that enumerate multiple emotions/needs in quick succession (e.g., 'Einsamkeit, Scham, Liebe') because lists create perceived authority and speed.",
      "Remove segments that require long setup, analogies, or multi-step explanations (e.g., immune system as city, training of T-helper cells).",
      "Select segments that contain explicit, numeric prescriptions that can be screenshot/remembered (e.g., 'Vielfachen von 90 Minuten', '6,0 / 7,5 / 9,0 / 4,5 Stunden').",
      "Select segments that rapidly enumerate familiar life milestones (high recognition density: birth\u2192school\u2192job\u2192partner\u2192kids\u2192retirement) to create instant viewer alignment and momentum.",
      "Prefer segments that contain repeated time-markers or seasonal markers (e.g., 'schon wieder Weihnachten') because they compress time and intensify the 'life is slipping' feeling.",
      "Select segments that open with a concrete, counterintuitive numeric comparison (e.g., 'Vitamin C in 1 lettuce leaf \u2248 1 sheet of A4 paper')\u2014start clip on the first shocking claim, not on setup questions.",
      "Avoid segments requiring external visuals or long context (e.g., whale shark description, pricing, global aquarium counts) unless they are essential to the punchline; prefer self-contained micro-story beats.",
      "End on a named principle/lesson stated in one sentence ('Freude am Tun\u2026 ersetzt\u2026'); ensure the final line generalizes the story into a transferable takeaway.",
      "Keep segments where both perspectives are represented (she interprets, he responds; then he explains her subtext). This creates 'two-sided reveal' and prevents the clip from feeling like a rant.",
      "Prefer segments with punchy recurring nouns and concrete objects (pizzeria, pizza numbers, waitress) that are easy to visualize and caption.",
      "Select segments that open with a surprising, concrete number tied to a widely-known brand/category (e.g., 'McDonald 3.2B') rather than abstract science framing.",
      "Prioritize first-person culpability + moral reversal language (e.g., 'was haben wir denn da eigentlich gemacht? Seid ihr irre?') because it creates conflict and self-judgment without needing context.",
      "End on a prescriptive list with multiple actionable verbs (take different route, read X, meet new people, go new places) to deliver clear takeaway + shareability.",
      "Remove abstract ethical generalizations (e.g., 'Tiere einsperren ist nicht zeitgem\u00e4\u00df') when a visceral anecdote can embody the same point faster.",
      "Prefer segments that define the concept in one sentence and tie it to a commonly known anchor term (e.g., 'Junk Food kennt jeder' \u2192 'Junk Sleep'), enabling instant comprehension.",
      "End on an irreversible outcome stated plainly ('war er tot') to provide a definitive payoff and prevent the clip from feeling like a teaser.",
      "Keep segments that include a concrete time/urgency marker ('n\u00e4chste halbe Stunde', 'in 15 Minuten') to add stakes and pacing.",
      "Remove slow reflective passages, gratitude/values statements, or long descriptive storytelling that doesn't resolve within ~30-40 seconds.",
      "Select segments that form a complete micro-story arc (setup \u2192 escalation \u2192 twist \u2192 explanation) within <60s; prioritize self-contained anecdotes over abstract argumentation.",
      "Remove segments that require multi-step prerequisites or extended frameworks (e.g., explaining 'Tiefschlafverdichtung' at length) when the clip goal is a single actionable takeaway.",
      "Remove segments that broaden scope into policy/authority references (e.g., DGE guidelines, international comparisons, definitions like 'Molekularmediziner') when the viral angle is a single concrete product myth-bust.",
      "Prefer segments that contain at least one of: (a) direct instruction, (b) causal mechanism, (c) consequence stated in plain language, all within the same 10\u201320 second window.",
      "Avoid segments with multiple subordinate clauses or long preambles before the point; prioritize sentences that deliver a claim within the first 3\u20135 seconds of the segment.",
      "Keep segments that introduce a named concept (label) within 10\u201315 seconds (e.g., 'Social Jetlag') because labels increase memorability and make the clip feel 'scientific' without needing full context.",
      "Remove segments that are primarily conversational scaffolding (questions like 'Was sch\u00e4tzt du?', audience interaction, hedges) unless they add conflict; here the clip drops the estimate-question and jumps to the punchline.",
      "Select segments that open with a concrete analogy/metaphor mapping the topic to a universally understood domain (e.g., 'Schlafen ist wie Fu\u00dfball spielen') within the first sentence.",
      "Avoid segments where the punchline depends on previous definitions or multi-minute buildup; prioritize clips whose humor is contained in the selected lines.",
      "Avoid segments with heavy jargon density unless the jargon is the point of controversy; prioritize everyday language ('Umsatz', 'Dauerkonsument', 'Basisern\u00e4hrung').",
      "Start on a high-emotion, high-contrast statement (animals = like us) rather than biography, credentials, or setup from the host.",
      "Prefer segments where the speaker uses direct second-person address ('wie wir', 'wie sie alle hier sitzen') to force viewer self-involvement.",
      "Keep segments that include a clear injustice/constraint metric (e.g., '150 Quadratmeter', 'Gruppe ... nicht selbst gesucht') to make the argument falsifiable and sticky.",
      "Remove segments with stage context or meta-intro/outro (applause, 'Danke', 'wer mich kennt', 'dar\u00fcber m\u00f6chte ich sprechen') because they spend seconds without informational payoff.",
      "Keep segments that shift from facts \u2192 mechanism \u2192 thesis in a single breath (facts: revenues; mechanism: meds treat symptoms; thesis: nutrition/supplements address causes).",
      "End on a universal pain statement that mirrors audience experience (e.g., 'Wir schlafen genug und sind trotzdem nie ausgeruht') to create emotional closure and shareability.",
      "Choose segments containing a vivid, concrete scene the viewer can picture instantly (kids knocking on glass; ape turning away).",
      "Avoid segments where the core point depends on earlier definitions; prefer self-contained micro-lessons that stand alone without context.",
      "Choose segments with repeated pattern escalation (same action repeated with variation: \u20ac1 \u2192 50 Cent \u2192 10 Cent \u2192 nothing) because repetition creates rhythm and retention checkpoints.",
      "Prefer a 1-topic micro-story over multi-topic nutrition context: keep only the 'iceberg lettuce nutrient emptiness + industrial growing method' storyline; cut adjacent vitamin C-in-apple and RDA debate.",
      "Select segments that include a vivid sensory/emotional description of the downside (e.g., 'wie von einem LKW \u00fcberfahren') to spike attention and relatability.",
      "Avoid segments dominated by numbers/credentials unless they directly intensify the ethical punch (here, only '150 Quadratmeter' is kept because it dramatizes confinement).",
      "Remove segments with references to earlier talk context ('wie wir hier auf der B\u00fchne\u2026', seminar lists, personal backstory) unless they are essential to understand the clip in isolation.",
      "Select segments that end on a forward-driving promise or method (e.g., 'S\u00e4tze \u00fcbersetzen') so the last line functions as a cliffhanger/solution teaser.",
      "Remove framework/setup segments that require prior context (e.g., explaining the whole 'Tiefschlafverdichtung' system) unless they can be expressed as a single label + one-sentence definition.",
      "Select moments that contain a self-contained micro-skit: (1) premise, (2) dialogue example, (3) misunderstanding consequence, (4) interpretation/explanation.",
      "Select segments that name the phenomenon with a label (e.g., 'Schlaftrunkenheit') to increase perceived authority and memorability.",
      "Select consecutive segments that form a micro-arc: Command \u2192 Mechanism/term \u2192 Consequence, with no need for external references."
