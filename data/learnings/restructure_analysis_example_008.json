    "Keep segments that open with an immediately relatable conflict framed as a funny/true observation (e.g., 'Wir sprechen verschiedene Sprachen') rather than a philosophical setup.",

    "Prefer segments with direct speech/quoted dialogue (Q/A lines) because they create instant scene + characters without context.",
    "Keep segments where both perspectives are represented (she interprets, he responds; then he explains her subtext). This creates 'two-sided reveal' and prevents the clip from feeling like a rant.",
    "Choose segments with a clear escalating beat: question \u2192 wrong literal answer \u2192 time passes \u2192 internal frustration \u2192 explicit 'translation' reveal.",
    "Keep segments that include a concrete time/urgency marker ('n\u00e4chste halbe Stunde', 'in 15 Minuten') to add stakes and pacing.",
    "Select segments that end on a forward-driving promise or method (e.g., 'S\u00e4tze \u00fcbersetzen') so the last line functions as a cliffhanger/solution teaser.",
    "Remove segments that require prior narrative context (e.g., earlier life-meaning framing, seminar setup, audience exercises) to understand why it matters.",
    "Remove slow reflective passages, gratitude/values statements, or long descriptive storytelling that doesn't resolve within ~30-40 seconds.",
    "Avoid segments where the punchline depends on previous definitions or multi-minute buildup; prioritize clips whose humor is contained in the selected lines."
