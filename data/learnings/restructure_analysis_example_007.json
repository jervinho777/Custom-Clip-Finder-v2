    "Select segments that open with a concrete, counterintuitive numeric comparison (e.g., 'Vitamin C in 1 lettuce leaf \u2248 1 sheet of A4 paper')\u2014start clip on the first shocking claim, not on setup questions.",
    "Select segments that immediately answer 'why/ how' with a vivid mechanism explanation (e.g., 'never saw soil' \u2192 'grown on cotton in sugar bath' \u2192 'stacked greenhouses'). Keep the causal chain intact.",
    "Select segments that contain sensory/visualizable nouns and locations (Holland/Spain, Supermarkt, Boden/Erdreich, Wattebausch, Zuckerbad, Gew\u00e4chshaus, Etagen) because they generate imagery without needing visuals.",
    "Select segments that contain implicit consumer relevance ('in the supermarket', '19 or 29 cents') to anchor the claim in the viewer\u2019s daily life.",
    "Remove segments that are primarily conversational scaffolding (questions like 'Was sch\u00e4tzt du?', audience interaction, hedges) unless they add conflict; here the clip drops the estimate-question and jumps to the punchline.",
    "Remove segments that broaden scope into policy/authority references (e.g., DGE guidelines, international comparisons, definitions like 'Molekularmediziner') when the viral angle is a single concrete product myth-bust.",
    "Prefer a 1-topic micro-story over multi-topic nutrition context: keep only the 'iceberg lettuce nutrient emptiness + industrial growing method' storyline; cut adjacent vitamin C-in-apple and RDA debate.",
    "End on a strong evaluative button line ('Das ist brutal.') or equivalent moral verdict; if none exists, select the nearest high-emotion judgment sentence as the final segment."

      "Ends without a closing verdict or implication, producing a 'hanging' feeling and lower shareability.",
