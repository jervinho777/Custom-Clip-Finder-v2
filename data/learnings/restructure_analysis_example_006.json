    "Start on an imperative contrarian command that challenges a common habit (e.g., 'H\u00f6rt bitte auf \u2026'). Prioritize segments where the first sentence is actionable and slightly provocative.",
    "Select segments that immediately justify the command with a concrete analogy/metaphor that compresses complexity into a vivid image (e.g., 'Transatlantikflug Richtung New York' to explain circadian shift).",
    "Keep segments that introduce a named concept (label) within 10\u201315 seconds (e.g., 'Social Jetlag') because labels increase memorability and make the clip feel 'scientific' without needing full context.",
    "Prefer segments that define the concept in one sentence and tie it to a commonly known anchor term (e.g., 'Junk Food kennt jeder' \u2192 'Junk Sleep'), enabling instant comprehension.",
    "End on a universal pain statement that mirrors audience experience (e.g., 'Wir schlafen genug und sind trotzdem nie ausgeruht') to create emotional closure and shareability.",
    "Remove intro/credential/build-up segments (host introduction, speaker bio, mission statements, event context). If a segment contains names, accolades, or stage logistics, exclude it.",
    "Remove framework/setup segments that require prior context (e.g., explaining the whole 'Tiefschlafverdichtung' system) unless they can be expressed as a single label + one-sentence definition.",
    "Avoid segments with multiple subordinate clauses or long preambles before the point; prioritize sentences that deliver a claim within the first 3\u20135 seconds of the segment.",
