    "Select segments that form a complete micro-story arc (setup \u2192 escalation \u2192 twist \u2192 explanation) within <60s; prioritize self-contained anecdotes over abstract argumentation.",
    "Keep segments with an explicit, contrarian or prescriptive opener (imperative/negation), e.g., 'Arbeite niemals\u2026' to function as an immediate thesis.",
    "Prefer segments that introduce concrete characters + setting in the first 3\u20135s (e.g., 'Kinder\u2026 alter Mann\u2026 Stra\u00dfe') to reduce context load and increase comprehension without prior longform context.",
    "Choose segments with repeated pattern escalation (same action repeated with variation: \u20ac1 \u2192 50 Cent \u2192 10 Cent \u2192 nothing) because repetition creates rhythm and retention checkpoints.",
    "Include segments where numbers/amounts/countdowns change; numeric steps act as natural 'beat markers' and make the progression easy to follow.",
    "Keep segments that contain direct speech/quoted dialogue; dialogue provides natural cut points and increases perceived immediacy.",
    "End on a named principle/lesson stated in one sentence ('Freude am Tun\u2026 ersetzt\u2026'); ensure the final line generalizes the story into a transferable takeaway.",
    "Remove segments that rely on long philosophical framing, citations (e.g., Goethe), or multi-step conceptual buildup that requires >10s before the viewer understands the point.",
    "Remove segments with references to earlier talk context ('wie wir hier auf der B\u00fchne\u2026', seminar lists, personal backstory) unless they are essential to understand the clip in isolation.",
    "Avoid segments where the 'why it matters' is delayed beyond ~45s; if the explanation cannot land by the final 5\u20138s, do not select."
