  "segment_selection_rules": [
    "Select segments that start with a universal model/framework (e.g., 'Lebenslinie' timeline) that can be understood with zero context from the longform.",
    "Select segments that rapidly enumerate familiar life milestones (high recognition density: birth\u2192school\u2192job\u2192partner\u2192kids\u2192retirement) to create instant viewer alignment and momentum.",
    "Keep the first segment that contains a contrarian or alarming reframe (e.g., 'bei vielen Menschen f\u00e4ngt direkt danach der Anfang vom Ende an') because it converts recognition into tension.",
    "Keep segments that introduce a concrete, relatable 'stuckness' metaphor anchored in everyday routine (job route, projects, same pizzeria order) to make the abstract thesis visceral.",
    "End on a prescriptive list with multiple actionable verbs (take different route, read X, meet new people, go new places) to deliver clear takeaway + shareability.",
    "Prefer segments that contain repeated time-markers or seasonal markers (e.g., 'schon wieder Weihnachten') because they compress time and intensify the 'life is slipping' feeling.",
    "Remove segments that require biographical setup (e.g., personal history, origin story, childhood, 'how it started') unless they directly support the framework in <10 seconds.",
    "Remove atmospheric B-roll / scene-setting (river, paddling, 'watch the atmosphere') because it slows pacing and reduces idea-per-second in short-form.",
    "Remove medical/relationship backstory detail (injury, depression, breakup, clinics) when the viral clip goal is a broad, non-niche life lesson rather than empathy narrative.",
    "Avoid segments with long emotional buildup before the first clear point; short-form selection favors immediate thesis over gradual reveal.",
    "Prefer segments with punchy recurring nouns and concrete objects (pizzeria, pizza numbers, waitress) that are easy to visualize and caption.",
    "Select contiguous segments that already form a mini-arc (model \u2192 problem \u2192 consequence \u2192 advice) to minimize the need for editorial bridging."
